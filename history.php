<h2>History</h2>
<p>If you think about an instrument, more specifically a Greek instrument, the first one that should pop into your head is the Bouzouki. It is an instrument that has been around seemingly forever and yet it's origins are not well known. It is most likely a descendent of the ancient instrument Pandoura which is known as a long neck instrument and had a very distinctive sound. Modern Bouzouki on the other hand have a larger, rounder belly so that the sound can resonate more than the older variations. Therefore, we can say that the Bouzouki belongs to the family with a long neck, ruling out a lot of other possibilities.</p><br>

<p>The name "Bouzouki" is belived to have come from the word "Bozouk" which means "broken". This name then is apparently how it is because of the changes that were made to the instrument when it travelled from Eastern and Central Asia. The biggest change to the instrument that perhaps defines it happened during the 1920s (surprisingly recent!). After the first world war, a musician called Manolis Chiotis added a 4th pair of strings to the instrument which gives it its now iconic sound and more expressive possibilities which is still used and loved to this very day. </p><br>
